# AP-review-backend
Spring 2022 (January to May)
NOTE: neither the frontend or backend are currently running. The purpose of this project is to experiment with the relationship between the frontend and backend and learn
ways to improve websites.
This repository is used for the backend of my AP Review website.
In the AP Review website, students are supposed to leave information about AP courses they have taken. The student will enter their grade in the class, AP score,
teacher rating, hours of homework per night, and the overall difficulty of the class. After pressing "submit", their responses will be sent to the backend to be processed.
In the backend, the average response for each class will be calulated for the grade, AP score, hours of homework per night, and the overall difficulty. For the teacher
rating, the mode of the data will be returned. These average and majority values will be sent back to be displayed on the frontend for each respective class.
This backend models a Google Form, where data is entered and later displayed.
